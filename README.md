# PWA Windsurf Stats

This project combines my passion for windsurfing with data analytics to provide an interactive report on the Gran Canaria Pozo event. Utilizing Python for data scraping and Power BI for visualization, the report features:

- **Event Highlights**: Showcasing top heats, jumps, and wave scores for both men and women.
- **Rider Analysis**: Offering detailed breakdowns at the rider level.
- **Event Summaries**: Providing comprehensive overviews and in-depth results analysis.

The report's design aligns with the PWA website's aesthetic, ensuring a cohesive and user-friendly experience. A notable feature is the custom elimination visual created using **Deneb** and **Vega-Lite**, which illustrates rider progression through each round with detailed tooltips.

The dashboard is accessible via **GitHub Pages**, and the raw data is available on the **Sports Insights Hub**.

## Future Plans

In 2025, I plan to expand this project to include **SlalomX**, **Foil Slalom**, and **Freestyle events**, aiming to develop a template for live event updates.

## Feedback

I welcome feedback from the sports data visualization community and the PWA. Your insights are valuable as I continue to enhance this project.
